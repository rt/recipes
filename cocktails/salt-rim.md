Spread the salt on a plate in an even layer.
Take a lemon wedge and cut a notch in the middle: then slide it around the rim of the glass.
To rim the glass, youâ€™ll want the salt on the outside of the glass only, not the inside where it can fall into the drink. To do this, tilt the glass and gently rotate it so the outside edge goes into the salt.
Shake off any loose salt into the sink.

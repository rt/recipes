Is lime as good as lemon in a whiskey sour? OK, weâ€™ll be honest with you: Not
quite. In our opinion, the best sour is made with the smoother flavor of lemon
versus the zing of lime. The best classic sour drinks are all made with lemon:
the Amaretto Sour, Pisco Sour, Tequila Sour,  Gin Sour, or Vodka Sour. We
prefer saving our limes to make margaritas!

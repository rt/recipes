Egg white is optional, but classic
Now, you don’t have to make an amaretto whiskey sour with an egg white: but we highly recommend it! Bartenders have been adding egg whites to cocktails since the 1860’s. The texture and flavor that an egg white adds can’t be beat! Why? Two things; an egg white adds:

Frothy texture to the surface of the drink, making it more fun to drink
A creamy rich flavor, making it taste more delicious
If you’re worried about the safety of raw egg whites in cocktails, the risk of salmonella is very low. In fact: melons, salad, and peanuts, have more of a threat for salmonella than eggs! Here’s how to safely store and use eggs to minimize risk (via Food & Wine).


**Dry Shake** 

The dry shake agitates the egg white in the cocktail shaker so that it forms
the beautifully frothy foam topping. If you’re not using an egg white, you can
skip the shaking without ice and just shake it up like a normal cocktail.

- Place all ingredients in a cocktail shaker. Shake for 15 seconds without ice.
- Add ice to the cocktail shaker and shake again for 30 seconds.
- Strain into a glass and garnish. Voila!


There’s another technique that gets even more foam: it’s called the Reverse Dry Shake. For this technique, you shake the ingredients with ice first, then strain out the ice and shake again. We like the texture of the foam in a dry shake, and it’s most common for classic cocktails.

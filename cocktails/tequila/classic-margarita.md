1 ounce (2 tablespoons) Cointreau
¾ ounce (1 ½ tablespoons) fresh lime juice
Kosher salt or flaky sea salt, for the rim

Cut a notch in a lime wedge, then run the lime around the rim of a glass. Dip the edge of the rim into a plate of salt (or for a festive look, use our Margarita Salt).
Place all ingredients in a cocktail shaker with 4 ice cubes and shake until cold.
Strain the margarita into the glass with the salted rim. Fill the glass with ice and serve.

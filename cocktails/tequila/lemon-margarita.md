3 tablespoons (1 ½ ounces) tequila
2 tablespoons (1 ounce) Cointreau
1 ½ tablespoons (¾ ounce) fresh lemon juice
Kosher salt or flaky sea salt, for the rim

Cut a notch in a lemon wedge, then run the lemon around the rim of a glass. Dip the edge of the rim into a plate of salt (or for a festive look, use our Margarita Salt).
Place all ingredients in a cocktail shaker with 4 ice cubes and shake until cold.
Strain the margarita into the glass with the salted rim. Fill the glass with ice and serve.

*Why not use the ice in the shaker*

You do the shake with ice for rapid cooling, thorough mixing, some amount of
dilution and finally to get a little bit of finely crushed ice floating on top
of the drink as a texture thing.

Pouring the drink off of the ice arrests the dilution process at a desirable
level of dilution, now in most cases a shaken drink is going to be poured into
a coupe or martini glass with no ice. However in the case where you are pouring
onto ice cubes in highball or rocks glass you are substantially slowing the
dilution process down at that point since the shaken ice has more surface area
for melting to occur, but frankly it's really mostly about the visual appeal of
the drink, fresh ice just looks nicer in the glass.

As for stirred cocktails it's mostly the most practical way to go from a lot of
ice in the stirring vessel to a much smaller amount of ice in the glass (thus
greatly reducing the surface area and dilution rate), one could pick ice out of
the mixer with tongs and move it to the glass before straining but that would
be a messy operation.

The only time I would do a dirty dump would be if I had a really boozy drink
that I wanted to keep diluting in the glass before it got drunk, but only if I
didn't have pebble ice or crushed ice to pour the drink into.

What is Cointreau?
Cointreau is a clear, orange-flavored liqueur with a lightly sweet, citrus perfume flavor. It is a type of triple sec liquor, which means “triple dry” in French. The first bottles were sold in 1885 after the recipe was perfected by Edouard Cointreau and his family business, Cointreau Distillery. The business was family owned until until 1990, when it merged with French company Rémy Martin to form Rémy Cointreau.

What does Cointreau taste like?
Cointreau tastes balanced between bitter orange and sweet, with warm spices that add complexity on the finish. It has a fragrant aroma and a clean finish.

Are there any Cointreau substitutes? Look for the real thing if at all possible. If it’s not available, go for Grand Marnier (a French orange liqueur made with brandy), Triple Sec, Orange Curaçao, or any other type of orange liqueur.

Why we like it
Cointreau is a classic orange liqueur that’s part of the standard lexicon of cocktails, most importantly two classic sours, the Margarita and Sidecar. The clean, orange perfume flavor is second to none. It’s a must in any liquor collection!

How much does it cost?
Compared to other liquors, Cointreau is mid-priced. A 375 ml bottle costs around $20 to $25, and a 750 ml bottle costs around $30 to 35. Cointreau is typically used in small amounts, around 1 ounce per drink, so a bottle will last you quite a while.

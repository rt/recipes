The Tom Collins is made with Old Tom Gin, a type of gin with a sweet flavor.
The John Collins is the original name of the drink, and sometimes refers to
this drink made with any type of gin. But the modern definition of a John
Collins is a Tom Collins made with whiskey. You can also make a Tom Collins
with vodka, called the Vodka Collins.

**ingredients**

2 ounces (4 tablespoons) dry gin
3/4 to 1 ounce (1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons) simple syrup or maple syrup
1 ounce (2 tablespoons) lemon juice
½ cup soda water
Ice (try our clear ice!)
For the garnish: maraschino cherry, lemon wheel

**instructions**

Add the gin, syrup and lemon juice to a cocktail shaker with 4 ice cubes. Shake well until chilled.
Strain the liquid into an ice filled glass, and top off the glass with soda water. Garnish with a lemon wheel and cocktail cherry.



- Shake in a cocktail shaker. Take gin, lemon juice, and syrup and shake it
together in a cocktail shaker with 4 ice cubes. (The number of ice cubes is
specific so the drink doesn’t get too watered down.)

- Strain into a glass and top off with soda water. Strain the drink into a glass
with ice cubes. Then top it off with soda water.

cherry for the full effect! You can also add a lemon wheel if you’d like.

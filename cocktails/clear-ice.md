# Make clear ice

Find a small cooler that fits inside your freezer. Then fill the cooler with 4
to 5 inches of warm tap water. Make sure the water is not hot! Place the cooler
inside your freezer with the lid off. That’s it! Freeze the cooler for 18 to 24
hours until several inches of the water have frozen. You’ll want to still have
some water left under the ice, which prevents the ice from getting cloudy.

When the block ice is ready, remove it from the cooler to get ready to get it
into cubes. To do so, place the cooler upside down in the sink for 5 to 10
minutes. The ice block may fall out on its own. Or, give it a gentle shake to
pop it out of the cooler.

Here’s where it gets fun! You’ll use a serrated knife to cut the ice into the
desired size of chunks. It will be less about cutting and more about scoring
the ice so that it snaps off. Here’s what to do:

- Hold the ice with a towel or oven mitt.
- Cut out a strip of ice: lightly score the top of the ice with a serrated knife, sliding the knife back and forth until a strip of the ice snaps off.
- Use the same scoring method to cut the strip into cubes.

For any ice you plan to serve right away, you can use an ice pick to hone the
final shape. There’s a whole art to shaping ice that we won’t pretend to be
experts in! We use an ice pick to hone the shape into what you see in the
pictures: like to make an ice sphere or to simply fit it into the glass.

# syrup

Place equal parts sugar and water in a saucepan. In this recipe, we used ½ cup
sugar and ½ cup water.

Heat over medium and whisk until the sugar dissolves. Resist the urge to
simmer! All you want is to dissolve the sugar.

Cool to room temperature. That’s it: you’re done! Cool to room temperature
before using.

**ingredients**

½ cup sugar
½ cup water

**instructions**

Add the sugar and water to saucepan and heat over medium heat.
Stir until sugar is dissolved (don’t bring to simmer) for 1 to 2 minutes. Cool to room temperature before using. Keeps in the refrigerator for 1 month.


### Honey simple syrup

**ingredients**

½ cup honey
½ cup water


**instructions**

Add the honey and water to saucepan and heat over medium heat.
Stir until the honey is dissolved (don’t bring to simmer!), about 1 to 2 minutes. Cool to room temperature before using. Keeps in the refrigerator for 1 month.

The best way to use honey syrup (in our opinion!) is in the classic cocktails that call for it! Here are a few famous honey cocktails to get you started:

Gold Rush A honey-based version of a whiskey sour.
Bees Knees This 1920’s gin cocktail features lemon and honey.
Penicillin A unique cocktail that swirls Scotch with lemon and honey.
Brown Derby This 1930’s cocktail features bourbon, grapefruit and honey.

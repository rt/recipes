What is sparkling water (carbonated water)?

What is sparkling water? Is it the same thing as carbonated water or soda
water? What about club soda? Here are some of the differences between these
very similar products:

- Sparkling water, aka seltzer, soda water, or carbonated water is water with no
additives, carbonated by injecting carbon dioxide (CO2). It’s the base for
brands like La Croix, or what comes out of a SodaStream.

- Sparkling mineral water is water from a natural mineral spring that’s been
carbonated. Examples of brands are Perrier or Topo Chico.  Keep in mind, many
sparkling water brands have added flavors or sweeteners. Make sure to look for
brands with no additives for your regular drinking, or if you’re using it for a
cocktail that calls for soda water.

Then what’s club soda? And tonic water?
Sparkling water has a few differences from other types of carbonated beverages. Here’s what to know about club soda and tonic water:

- Club soda is carbonated water infused with added minerals, which give it a
salty or lightly sweet flavor. Club soda is most often used for cocktails.
Stick to sparkling water for your regular drinking.

- Tonic water is carbonated water with added quinine and sugar. It was first sold
commercially in the 1850’s as a way to drink quinine, prescribed at the time to
fight malaria. It tastes sweet and bitter, and is mostly used in cocktails,
like the classic gin and tonic. 


Sparkling water or seltzer has been used in cocktails for hundreds of years.
You can use club soda interchangeably in cocktail recipes since it’s so
similar. Add bubbles to wine and you’ve got a wine spritzer! Add it to gin and
you’ve got a Gin Rickey. There are so many tasty drinks try: here are some of

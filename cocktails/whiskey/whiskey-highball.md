**ingredients**

2 ounces whiskey
4 ounces soda water (or ginger ale or ginger beer, for a sweeter spin*)
Lemon wedge
Ice, for serving (try clear ice!)

**instructions**

Fill a glass with ice. Pour in the whiskey and soda water and stir gently.
Squeeze in the lemon wedge and serve.

Notes
*Soda water is the most traditional and is very spirit-forward. Ginger ale or ginger beer results in a more balanced drink because it adds sweetness.

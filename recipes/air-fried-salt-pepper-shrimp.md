# AIR-FRIED SALT & PEPPER SHRIMP

-- from internet, Andrea Nguyen, author of Vietnamese Food Any Day!

**ingredients**

- 8 pieces jumbo shrimps, in shell (I would try without shell, next time)
- 1⁄4 + 1/8 tsp white pepper
- 1⁄4 tsp fine sea salt, or 1⁄2 tsp coarse kosher salt
- 1-1/2 tsp corn starch or potato starch
- 1 tbsp + 1-1/2 tsp canola oil
- 1 jalapeno or serrano chili, thinly sliced w/seeds intact
- 1 tbsp chopped garlic

**instructions**

- 1 Use scissors to cut shell along back of shrimp; trim feet, devein, pat dry -- I would remove shell...
- 2 Mix seasonings in bowl (To simplify, I would put chile and garlic in mix)
- 3 Add shrimp into bowl, rub seasoning into shrimp
- 4 Drizzle on 1-1/2 tsp oil and toss in mixture to coat
- 5 Preheat air fryer at 425F to 450F for 3 to 5 minutes
- 6 Place shrimp on rack
- 7 Air fry for 2 minutes, until crisp on top, orange in color
- 8 Turn shrimp over, cook 90 s longer to make other side crisp
- 9 Remove from fryer, let sit for few minutes
- 10 Warm 1 tbsp oil in skillet over medium-high heat; when barely simmering, add chili and garlic; cook for 15 to 30 seconds, until aromatic
- -- To simplify, I would skip the pan frying with chili and garlic
- 11 Add shrimp and cook, stirring to warm shrimp, and coat with seasoning for 1 minute
- 12 When garlic pieces are golden, turn off heat, transfer to serving plate (will all bits remaining in pan)
- 13 Serve hot or warm.

**notes**

Another recipe calls for garlic powder, Italian seasoning, paprika, salt, pepper.
Not sure what Italian seasoning is, whether in powder form, or sald dressing.
Chili powder worked pretty well. Can try chili pepper next time.

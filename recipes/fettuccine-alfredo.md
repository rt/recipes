# Fettuccine Alfredo

Instant Pot

**ingredients**

- 3 Tbsp Butter, cut in a few small pieces
- 4 cloves Garlic, pressed/minced (or 1 1/2 tsp Garlic Powder)
- 2 cups Chicken Broth
- 1 1/2 cups Heavy Cream
- 1 tsp Salt (or more to taste)
- 1/2 tsp Pepper
- 10 oz Fettuccine Noodles, broken in half
- 1 lb Chicken Breasts, uncooked cut in bite sized pieces (chicken is optional)
- 1 cup Parmesan Cheese, grated

**instructions**

- Place the butter and garlic in the pot.
- Pour in the chicken broth and heavy cream.
- Sprinkle in the fettuccine noodles, in a random pattern, and gently press them down.
- If Adding Chicken: Add the chicken, and space evenly over the noodles. Sprinkle with the salt and pepper.
- Press down on the mixture to submerge as many of the noodle as possible. Then place the lid on the pot, lock in place, and set the steam release knob to Sealing position.
- Press the Pressure Cook/Manual button or dial, then the +/- to select 6 minutes (7 minutes for a softer noodle). After the cook cycle has finished, let the pot sit undisturbed for 5 minutes (5 minute natural release). 
- Manually release the remaining pressure in short bursts so no sauce spews out with the steam.
- Carefully open the lid and give the mixture a good stir. It may be a little soupy, but it will thicken up.
- Add the grated parmesan and stir it in. If it's still a little too thin, just add a little more parmesan.

# Risotto

Instant Pot


ingredients
2 tablespoons olive oil (or butter)
1 white or yellow onion, diced
4 garlic cloves, rough chopped
2 cups Arborio rice or short grain Spanish rice (Bomba)
1/4 cup white wine
4 cups veggie stock or chicken stock or broth
1 teaspoon salt
1/2  teaspoon pepper
——
1/2 – 1 cup parmesan (or sub other cheeses- pecorino, manchego, goat, etc. )
drizzle of olive oil or a couple tablespoons of butter (optional)
lemon zest from one lemon, optional
more stock or broth to the desired consistancy
Optional Additions:

Sauteed Mushrooms (or smoked mushrooms)
Roasted butternut squash  and sage
sauteed asparagus and lemon zest
spring peas and tarragon
olive oil roasted tomatoes
Pressure cook for 6 mins on high.

You could saute 1 pound of sliced mushrooms with the onion and garlic then pressure cook them along with the risotto. This would also work well with  cubes of butternut, corn, or veggies that would discolor or get too overcooked.



instructions
Heat the oil on “saute” function on the Instant Pot. Saute onion and garlic until tender ad fragrant, about 3-4 minutes. Add Arborio rice and saute one minute.

Add wine and cook this off,  about 2 mintues. Add the stock and bring to a light simmer, scraping up any browned bits. Stir in salt and pepper. If adding any dried herbs, add now.

Set Instant pot to High Pressure for 6 minutes. Manually release after 5 minutes (letting this naturally release all the way may result in rice that is slightly overcooked )

Stir in the lemon zest, grated parmesan or other cheese, optional butter, and any optional addtions you like.

Then stir in a little more broth to loosen it up and give it nice creaminess.

Adjust salt and pepper. Divide among bowls and top with fresh herbs  and more finely grated cheese.

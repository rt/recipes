# Yakiniku



**sauce**

1/3 cup soy sauce
3 tablespoons sugar
1 tablespoon white miso
1 tablespoon ginger juice or 1/2 to 1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon garlic minced
1 tablespoon crushed red pepper or to taste, keep it coarse or crush fine
Mirin to taste, can use cooking sake as a substitute

In a mixing bowl, add all of the ingredients and stir to combine.
Pour the sauce into a saucepan over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Once simmering, lower the heat and allow the sauce to thicken. While thickening, adjust the crushed red pepper, miso, and mirin (or cooking sake used) until you get your desired balance of flavor. 

Remove from the heat and allow the sauce to cool. Use immediately. Or for best flavor, cover the yakiniku sauce and refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours to allow the flavors to meld.

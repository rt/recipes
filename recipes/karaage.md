# 唐揚げ

骨なし、皮なしチキン６枚位に対し、
醤油大さじ4、酒大さじ2位、チューブの生姜(ジンジャー)1／3本
でもいつも目分量だけどね。
あげる時に片栗粉つけるよ



Chicken Thighs (if have boneless even better)

Cut in bite size pieces and put in bag.
Add even amount of shoyu and sake, maybe a little less sake, so that fully soaked.
Add shoga (tube) to liking (pretty much)
Leave for 1hr.

Put karakuriko and deep fry for 5 min.,  or cook in fry pan but not as crispy.
